## About

It's a small project made for learning wordpress purposes. It has listing of available cars with filter option. The page also has all the nevessary contact details - address, tel number and a map location. Customer reviews are an extra added to the project. <br/>So I guess smaller businesses would be interested to have such a simple but practical page since that was my purpose of creating it.
